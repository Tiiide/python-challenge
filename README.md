Homework for Module 3 - Python

For this assignment, we were challenged to use Python to scan CSV files for string and numeric data.

This required us to use Python to read specific data from a CSV file, perform mathematical operations based on

the data retrieved from this file, and output our results in the terminal and in a text file saved in a specific directory.
